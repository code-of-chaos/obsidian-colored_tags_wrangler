| Note Background color, dependant on a tag in the note's properties. <br> (note: currently works when you refresh the page. This is in the works of being changed in the future)                                                                                  | ![background_example.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/code-of-chaos/obsidian-colored_tags_wrangler/master/assets/example-note_background.png)  |

- The ability to define a tag with a Foreground and Background color by Color Pickers
	- `Enable button for Auto Background coloring` : Enables a button next to the color pickers to automatically assign
	  a background color based on the foreground color.
	- `Enable multiple tags per line` : Want to have multiple tags have the same color? Simply enable this button and
	  write each tag on a different line or separate them by `;`
- Obsidian Core Plugins:
	- Canvas Cards : Apply a tag color to a Canvas Card
- Community Plugins:
	- The [Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) plugin.
		- Apply a tag's colors to a Kanban card which has that tag in its body.
		- Apply a tag's colors to a Kanban list, when a tag is present in the title.
		- Allows users to omit the `#` from tags in the Kanban view
	- Integration with tags within Folder Notes's properties
		- Setting to apply color to a folder, if the folder's note has a colored tag within its file's properties.
		- This isn't really tied to a single plugin. I
		  use [AidenLX's FolderNote](https://github.com/aidenlx/alx-folder-note) for this, but any file that has the
		  same name as the folder in which it is in will work

## Example Vault

If you want to mess around with the tags, an example vault has been created for you:

## Known Issues

The following is a list of known issues. If you know how to fix them, then all help is welcome.

- if a Kanban card, canvas card, or a folder note, has more than one colored tag within it, it isn't always clear why
  CSS chooses the given color.
